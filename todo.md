# Todo
- update assets:
  - replace default pfp
- put eventcards into eventlist component (?)
  - will this make rerendering better or worse?
- add date header component
- make app.js into functional component
  - fix rerendering + api request on event display change
- add a virtual venue link (button)
- fix sidebar states to be active vs inactive rather than inactive vs sidebar
- make speaker component work with our urls (or keep photos locally)
- rethink sidebar component update logic (whether it still needs the changeEvent as props)
- fix newline in description 
- put eventtime component on sidebar
- fix the sidebar classes ????????
  - maybe use a function to return class instead of confusing ternary
  - also remember that sidebar should always be applied, add "active" class
- Change icon and page title
