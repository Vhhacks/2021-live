# Todo
- update assets:
  - replace header logo
  - replace default pfp
- change colour for workshop to vhh purple
- put eventcards into eventlist component (?)
  - will this make rerendering better or worse?
- include start time in event card
- add date header component
- make app.js into functional component
  - fix rerendering + api request on event display change
- add a virtual venue link (button)
- fix sidebar states to be active vs inactive rather than inactive vs sidebar
- make speaker component work with our urls (or keep photos locally)
- rethink sidebar component update logic (whether it still needs the changeEvent as props)
- fix newline in description
